# EnigmaCrypt

EnigmaCrypt is a successor project to [PlainTextVault](https://github.com/thtskaran/PlainTextVault), an open-source encryption tool for plain text files using the AES encryption standard. Building upon the foundation of PlainTextVault, EnigmaCrypt aims to provide a more versatile and robust solution for encrypting various types of files, regardless of their size or format.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of EnigmaCrypt is to address the need for secure storage of confidential files on cloud platforms without the risk of exposure. It offers a user-friendly interface and a command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting files, ensuring the privacy and integrity of sensitive data.

## Features

- Supports encryption of any file type, including documents, images, videos, and more
- Handles files of any size, making it suitable for both small and large-scale encryption needs
- Utilizes strong encryption algorithms to ensure the highest level of security
- Provides a simple and intuitive user interface for ease of use
- Offers a command-line interface for advanced users and automation purposes
